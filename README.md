# RustSim
A process oriented discrete simulation library

### Requirements
This library uses experimental feature generators.

To use this library you need Rust nightly with version at least v1.58 but a greater version with support for `#![feature(generators))` will likely work too.

### Running the examples

You can run the examples with
```
cargo run --examples [example_name]
```
you may omit the `example_name` if you wish to execute all examples
